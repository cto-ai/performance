# Performance - Website Performance

Performance Op utilizes opensource tools such WebPageTest and Lighthouse to check your website's performance.

> **WebPageTest** is an open source performance testing tool, maintained primarily by Google. It consists of one or multiple servers that act as web browsing robots, visiting websites and automatically collecting data about the experience in the form of a detailed performance report.


> **Lighthouse** analyzes web apps and web pages, collecting modern performance metrics and insights on developer best practices.

## Requirements

To run this or any other Op, install the [Ops Platform](https://cto.ai/platform).

Find information about how to run and build Ops via the [Ops Platform Documentation](https://cto.ai/docs/overview).

This Op also requires API Key for WebPageTest.

- To Create one, visit <https://www.webpagetest.org/getkey.php>
- Set WebPageTest API Key to `WEBPAGETEST_APIKEY` in team secrets by running `ops secrets:set`
- Once you've set your API Key in secrets, the Op will skip API Key Prompt as it will automatically fetch the key from your team's secret storage.
